## INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE APP (.app and .exe)

## INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE APP (.app and .exe)

1. **Always start by creating a BACKUP COPY of your .bin file** so that even if it gets corrupted you can start over. If you lose your .bin file, DM me on discord for a copy of mine. Again, DM me, do not message in any discord server.

2. **While changing Digimon Images**, your New Digimon Images should have the same color count as your Old Digimon Images. Use some tool like [Canvas Pixel Color Counter](https://townsean.github.io/canvas-pixel-color-counter) to find the color count of your images.

3. **While changing Digimon Names**, your New Digimon Name should have the same length as your Old Digimon Name. Use _ for whitespace. Only alphabets A-Z allowed, no numbers or symbols. Examples:
   - FLORAMON has 8 letters, but I want to change it to KUDAMON which has only 7 letters. Then in the tool, I will type `KUDAMON_` to make it 8 characters. The underscore _ represents a blank space.
   - BELIALVAMDEMON has 14 letters. And I want to change it to BEELZEBUMON X which has blank spaces and 12 letters. Then in the tool, I will type `BEELZEBUMON_X_` to make it 14 characters. The underscore _ represents a blank space.

4. **While changing Digimon Power**, the Power value needs to be between 0 to 225. Anything outside this range WILL BREAK YOUR Digivice.

5. **While changing Digimon Stage**, the Power value needs to be between 1 to 5. Anything outside this range WILL BREAK YOUR Digivice. The mapping is:
   - 1 => Child / Rookie
   - 2 => Adult / Champion
   - 3 => Perfect / Ultimate
   - 4 => Ultimate / Mega
   - 5 => Super Ultimate / Ultra

6. **DO NOT ABORT any operation once it starts**, even if you want to cancel it. Even if you want to cancel, just wait for it to complete and try again. The Cancel option of the app works most of the times, but sometimes could cause glitches. But avoid it just to be safe.

7. The app might have bugs and would be slower because the code is the first un-optimized draft. I will try to optimize it further later.
